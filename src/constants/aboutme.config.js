  careerFull:
    "I began my journey as a self-taught developer when I was introduced to technology during my first year of college. I was an average kid with little tech knowledge. When the pandemic hit, everything moved online, and I got my elder brother's friend's laptop to attend classes.\n\nI remember the day I took a book in my hand titled *Programming in C*. My brother and I were both trying to write a code snippet, copying it word-for-word into an online GCC compiler. Unsurprisingly, it failed—beginner minds! LOL 😂\n\nAs the pandemic continued, I started learning web development. I began with the God languages of HTML and CSS, then moved on to JavaScript. From there, the cycle began: I learned many technologies over time, mastering them one by one. I worked with many clients and completed internships, learning something new each time. That's how my journey is going now.",
