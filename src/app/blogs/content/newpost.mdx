## In Javascript/Typescript we can do.

```jsx
console.log("Hello World");
```

### In Python we can do. 

```jsx
print("Hello World");
```

No no don't worry i was just kidding that's not what i want to speak in this blog. 
I know that if you are reading this then you want to start coding. 

So yeah let's begin & let me know if this works for you!

## What is coding/programming?
It's a process of writing instructions for a computer to perform tasks. It involves creating a set of instructions, called programs, that a computer can follow.

Computers can read different programming languages, each used for different tasks. Some common programming languages include JavaScript, Typescript, Python, and C++.

Inshort if you know how to give instructions to the computer to perform some task then you can perform tasks that you want/imagine. Didn't get me ? Fine i was saying if you can think and you know how to code then you have superpowers in this tech world.


## Deep knowledge ðŸ§ 
It's the same way how your life works. You never know what will be the future you never know the outcome will be in your favour or not. But do you stop doing your work ? No, right?

Exactly just like that you don't need to learn the proper way to do something, Just do something to know the proper way of doing it.

## Suggestions 
Dear, if you want to learn coding i will suggest you start with python just like i did. If you want to copy my whole process then its well and good. But instead of bots you can do other things that you find fascinating and in which you get the community support.

Just see how others do the same thing and ask yourself if you can understand that particular small part of the code, That may be a function or anything.
If you understand it then try to make changes. And am sure 95% of the time you will make errors. That's what we need dude! As i said you need to make errors to learn the correct way of doing it.

And i will suggest you to start with VS Code or any particular code editor and a laptop.
If you can't buy a laptop somehow then don't be sad look at me dude. Look at my journey.
Use your fucking phone and go on.

Don't buy a course in the begning learn everything for free from YouTube.

## The End
Having consistency and motivation to do something is the key of success.
If you find my blog helpful/motivating don't forget to thanks me later.
